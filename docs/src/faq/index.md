## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many years of experience do you have?

I have been programming in Java professionally since 2016. I've worked on nodejs projects and have done a little bit of
work with vuejs. I'm mostly backend but I do know a little bit of the frontend. I also program in kotlin which is the
main language I use when building personal projects.

### Why are you looking for a new position?

In April of 2022, the company I was with decided they needed to 'refocus' the company. They laid off the CTO and a
number of software engineers which included myself. In all honesty, I was ready to look for something new anyway. So
I've been wanting a change for a while now. In the meantime I've been studying and improving my skills. I've been
working on learning system design.

### What did you work on at your previous position?

The two main products of Keap are Infusionsoft and Keap; they are both CRMs for small businesses. The team I was on was
working on "Easy Automations" which was a feature of Keap that allowed our customers to create automations. The
automations had triggers and actions. An example of an easy automation would be something like "when a contact fills out
a form, move them into the first stage of a sales pipeline" The front end was built with vuejs. The backend was a java
micronaut webserver running in GKE in GCP (google cloud platform). We also maintained a small nodejs server, and
graphql (node based) server. The data side included postgresql, firestore, and pubsub.

### What are your strengths?

I'm mostly backend. I've used spring boot in the past, but it's been a few years. I was mainly working with micronaut (
java based framework that is highly inspired by spring) and some nodejs. I use kotlin a lot when working on personal
projects and prefer it as a language. I know a small amount of javascript/typescript as well.

### Are you open to a full stack position?

Absolutely! Most of my knowledge is on the backend but if a company was willing to let me grow into a full stack
position I
would totally go for it.
