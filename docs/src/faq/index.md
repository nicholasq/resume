## 5 minute summary

### How many years of experience do you have?

I have been programming in Java professionally since 2016. I've worked on nodejs projects and have done a little bit of
work with vuejs. I'm mostly backend, but I do have a beginner's level knowledge of the frontend. I also program in
Kotlin which is the main language I use when building personal projects.

### Why are you looking for a new position?

In April 2022, the company I was with decided they needed to 'refocus' the company. They laid off the CTO and a
number of software engineers which included myself. In all honesty, I was ready to look for something new anyway. So
I've been wanting a change for a while now. In the meantime, I've been studying and improving my skills. I've mostly
been working on learning system design.

### What did you work on at your previous position?

The two main products of Keap are Infusionsoft and Keap; they are both CRMs for small businesses. The team I was on was
working
on ["Easy Automations"](https://keap.com/business-success-blog/marketing/automation/introducing-easy-automations)
which was a feature of Keap that allowed our customers to create automations. The automations had triggers and actions.
An example of an easy automation would be something like "when a contact fills out a form, move them into the first
stage of a sales pipeline". The front end was built with vuejs, and the backend was a Java Micronaut webserver running
in GKE in GCP (google cloud platform). We also maintained a small nodejs server, and graphql (node based) server. The
data side included postgresql, firestore, and pubsub.

### What are your strengths?

I'm mostly backend. I've used Spring Boot in the past, but it's been a few years. I was mainly working with Micronaut
(Java based framework that is highly inspired by Spring) and some nodejs. I use Kotlin a lot when working on personal
projects and prefer it as a language. I know a small amount of Javascript/Typescript as well.

### Are you open to a full stack position?

Absolutely! Most of my knowledge is on the backend but if a company was willing to let me grow into a full stack
position I would totally go for it.
